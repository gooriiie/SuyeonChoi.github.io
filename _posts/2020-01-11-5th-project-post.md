Robot movement team's work was moving P3-AT robot using program.  
So we(Robot movement team) tried to move it.    

We used ROS and Aria.  
ROS is Robot Operation System and Aria is a library about this robot.  
We didn't know anything about them, so we followed ROS tutorial.    

Conclusively, we moved it but it is not perfect.  
Because when we commanded it to move, using RosAria, it moved only during 1 sec.  
So we needed to find other way to move it.  
Then, we decided to find a way to move it using API code.  
That could be about C++, or Python.    

This was so hard because I had not used it before.  
But I was so interested.
