We assigned works.  
1. Maintain network and get GPS  
1. get GPS(from 1) and move robot using GPS, distance and degree between commander's GPS and robot's GPS    

This was not finished, but our team decided a detailed topic implemented when finished.  
The topic is that "**distinguishing between our army and enemy recognizing military uniform**".  
That needs to use machine learning technology.
